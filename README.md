## Data files

The full dataset (`products_stores_stocks_with_prices.csv`, ~160 MB) is not included in this repository.

To run the app with real data:
1. Obtain the dataset separately
2. Place it in the `data/` folder
3. Update `STOCK_CSV_PATH` in `config.py` if needed

A small sample dataset is provided for demo and testing.
